The night is just like every other night. You are doing your nightly routine which involves smoking a cigarette. Pulling out your lighter, you notice a woman in the midnight cafe nearby. Strange, you have never seen her before, even tho you are walking here every night. She is wearing the cafe's uniform, has a little notepad. Early model with a faulty screen, but it's a common choice for people with less money in their pocket. She is serving some customers, ordinary people. Seems like a couple, one of them is person, the other female one is an omnic. A newer one actually.
