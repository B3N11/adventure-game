doNothingBA normal
You lean your back to the side of the building and shut your eyes. You re enjoying the distant sounds of mechanical street musicians while slowly smoking your cigarette. Your thoughts once again wonder to the woman and her character, the Evening Swan. The futuristic ligths and the absurd choreography of the play amases you. You stand like this for minutes.\nYou eventually decide to head home. Walking on the street you pass the people of the city. This is the capital city, but a lower level of it. People call it "The Middle". Above them live the rich and powerful people who rule over the crowd here and Below. "Below" is a place you would never want to visit. Those who fall end up there...and they usually don't stand up.\nWalking home you encounter a strange omnic. One of his arms is missing, his body tells a sad story, he is probably a veteran from the wars. He waves at you, even tho you are only a couple of meters away.
